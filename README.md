Piwik-Tracker
=============

http://github.com/jkraemer/piwik-tracker

Ruby client library for the [Piwik](http://piwik.org) opensource web
analytics application.

With Piwik-Tracker you can record visits, page views and goal conversions
in a Piwik server from within any ruby application.

Think of it as a Ruby version of the piwik.js standard Tracking API.
For more information, see http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/

Inspired by the PiwikTracker.php script that comes with Piwik.
